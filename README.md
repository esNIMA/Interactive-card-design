## Overview

- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:

## My process

### Built with
- React.js
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned
I practiced and learned tons of new things. I learned how to use the useEffect hook, how to manage states, and how to perform conditional rendering. 
I also practiced with CSS animations and how to create a responsive web design.


### Continued development
Adding redux as the state manager can be a good goal for further development.
